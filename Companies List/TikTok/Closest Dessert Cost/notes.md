* The approach I worked with is a complicated one and is not really needed. 
* Instead, we could have three different recursive calls per topping. We don't really have to pick them out of order. We can pick them in order. Hence, pass the index for the
topping as well and for each topping,
  * choose 1
  * choose 2
  * don't choose
