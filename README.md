# Yet another leetcode repository?

Well, yeah, this is basically to track my own Leetcoding journey over time. There's a great Chrome Extension that goes by the name of [LeetHub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leethub/aciombdipochlnkbpcbgdpjffcfdbggi?hl=en) that automatically pushes your code to Github as soon as it is accepted by Leetcode for a problem.

That being said, there are a few things I wanted to have in my own leetcode repo, namely:
* Better organization of problems like folders for a single problem containing all the solutions.
* Chronological journey for problem solving as well.
* Adding problems under Leetcode contests if that's where I found them from.

# Sounds like a plan, but this is manual. Eww!

Yeah well, there's definitely scope for improving the extension itself to add all these features but for now, I'll stick with the pleasures of pushing to my branch, myself!

# Contributions

I'd love to have contributions to this repository but I need to think along what lines they can be. For now, it's going to be commits from just me and I'll figure out scope for contributions along the way.
